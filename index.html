  <h1>Rob Ashton</h1>
  <p>Is no longer reading his e-mails, doing talks, taking requests for blog entries, etc</p>
  <p>Most of this site is still archived and accessible, but I've no desire to promote it in any way</p>
  <p>Yes, everything is okay - I'm just fed up of "doing the circuit", and have decided to go forward and achieve my dreams of being Scotlands first hobo taimer.</p>
  <p>I will happily accept donations of hooch.</p>
